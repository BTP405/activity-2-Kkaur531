(10 points) Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.
    1. (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
    2. (3 points) What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?



```
#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

```
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```

```
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```
1. Each Program Snippet's Description: 
Approach 1: The `doubleL(n)} function uses a for loop and the `append` method to construct a list of doubled numbers from 0 to n-1. Next, the `for` loop iterates through the list that `doubleL(5)` returned, printing each number behind a colon.

Approach 2:  This approach directly creates a list of doubled numbers from 0 to 4 (range(5)) by using a list comprehension. Then, iterating over this list, the `for` loop prints each number, separated by a colon.

Approach 3:  The `doubleG(n)} function is a generator function that uses a for loop to produce doubled values from 0 to n-1. The given values from {doubleG(5)} are then iterated over by the `for` loop, which prints each number followed by a colon.


2. The existence of the `yield` keyword makes the function {doubleG(n)} a generator function. Unlike a list, it does not produce and store every value in memory at once. Rather, when iterated over, it yields one value at a time. Utilizing a method like this has the benefit of potentially being more memory economical, particularly when handling lengthy value sequences. Additionally, because values are only generated upon request, it permits slow evaluation, which is advantageous in situations where all values are not required at once.
